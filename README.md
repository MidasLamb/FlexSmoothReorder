# FlexSmoothReorder
Animates the reordering of flex items.

## How to use
Just include the file and add the class `smooth-reorder` to the flex container of which you want to animate the children when they reorder.

## Limitations
Currently, the animation only takes place when you add a class, such as the Bootstrap 4 `order-12`.

# Example
